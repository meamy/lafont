-- This is a variation on example.deriv: in example.deriv, it was necessary to apply the
-- first relation at either position 0 or position 4. Applying rel2 anywhere else would
-- yield a string of the form ((abc1)^i).lmnop.((abc1)^j) for some i > 0 and j > 0. From
-- this string, the relation rel2 is no longer applicable.
--
-- In this file the first relation is applied at position 2. The second step of the
-- derivation fails as a result.

rel2 → 2
rel2 → 0 -- This step is not applicable.
