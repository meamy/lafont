-- Illustrates the use of derived rules.
-- This proof assumes that example1.derivs and example2.derivs are also inlcuded.
-- They are then available as DerivedRel1 and DerivedRel2.
--
-- Intended generators: example.gens
-- Intended relations: example.rels
-- Intended derivations: example1.derivs, example2.derivs
