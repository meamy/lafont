-- Note that the relations in this file use → rather than =.
-- This states that each relation may only be applied left-to-right.
-- In practice, Tietze allows for a mix of equation and directed rules.
-- In this example, all rewrite rules are directed.

rel1 w   → x.y.y
rel2 w   → z.y.z.y
rel3 x   → x.x
rel4 x.x → ε
rel5 z.y → y.z
rel6 y.y → ε
rel7 z.z → y.y
